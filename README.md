# anatomically_defined_CNNs

This code base was developed to house the materials for my talk during the 2019 OHBM full day Educational Course on Deep Learning in Rome, Italy.

data - several T1w images we will use to test/evaluate the pre-trained network. The full dataset used to train the model can be accessed here (you need to log on to NITRC and will need to register with the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project website on NITRC to gain access to the HBN neuroimaging datasets): http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/index.html
notebooks - code we will walk through together.
checkpoints - saved models.
